                <h1>JOHNNY BRAVO</h1>
                <p>Johnny Bravo is an American animated television series created by Van Partible for Cartoon Network,
                    and the second of the network's Cartoon Cartoons, which aired from July 14, 1997, to August 27,
                    2004.
                    The series centers on the title character, a sunglasses-wearing, muscular young man who lives with
                    his
                    mother and attempts to get women to date him, though he is usually unsuccessful. He ends up in
                    bizarre
                    situations and predicaments, often accompanied by celebrity guest characters such as Donny Osmond or
                    Adam West. Throughout its run, the show was known for its adult humor and pop culture references.
                    Johnny himself is loosely based on Elvis Presley.

                    Partible pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animation showcase What a Cartoon!,
                    basing it on his senior thesis project he produced while attending Loyola Marymount University.
                    A pilot short aired on Cartoon Network in 1995. The series was renewed for a second season in 1999,
                    during which Partible left and the show was retooled under the direction of Kirk Tingblad. In 2003,
                    Partible returned for the series' fourth season, restoring it to its original format and style.
                    A total of four seasons and 67 episodes have aired. The first three seasons were produced by
                    Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, and the fourth season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios.</p>
